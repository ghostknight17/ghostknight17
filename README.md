# Hello! I'm Lucas from Argentina.

I'm a beginner web developer who is passionate about coding and learning new things. I started my journey into web development this year and I'm excited to see where it takes me.

## What I'm currently learning

Currently, I'm focusing on building a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm also interested in design, other programming languages and technology in general. I understand that I have a lot to learn, but I'm eager to take on new challenges and expand my skillset.

## Why I love coding

I love coding because it allows me to be creative and solve problems in a logical way. There's something incredibly satisfying about taking a complex problem and breaking it down into smaller, manageable parts. Plus, I love that feeling of accomplishment when you finally get your code to work.

## My goals

My ultimate goal is to become a full-stack web developer and work on projects that make a positive impact on people's lives. I know that this is a long-term goal, and I have a lot of hard work ahead of me. But I'm determined to succeed, and I believe that with dedication and persistence, anything is possible.
